I have 4 independent test failures happening in different modules:

1. tests/auth/login.test.ts - "should redirect after login" is failing
2. tests/api/users.test.ts - "should return user list" returns 500
3. tests/components/Button.test.tsx - snapshot mismatch
4. tests/utils/date.test.ts - timezone handling broken

These are unrelated issues in different parts of the codebase. Can you investigate all of them?
