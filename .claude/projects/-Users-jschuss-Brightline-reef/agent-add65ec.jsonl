I'm Claude Code, Anthropic's official CLI for Claude, operating in READ-ONLY mode for this codebase exploration task.\n\nI have reviewed the context provided:\n\n**Key Information Absorbed:**\n- Working directory: `/Users/jschuss/Brightline/reef` (Rails 8.0.2 application)\n- Current branch: `TB-1901-care-case-search-waitlist`\n- Main branch: `main`\n- Platform: macOS (Darwin 24.6.0)\n- Repository status: Clean git state\n\n**Codebase Structure Understood:**\n- Multi-tenant Rails application with Members and Staffers interfaces\n- Event-driven architecture with Sidekiq background jobs\n- Component-based UI using ViewComponent (Lookbook available)\n- External integrations: Healthie, Candid, Sendbird, Auth0, etc.\n- TailwindCSS v4 for styling\n- React 17 + TypeScript for frontend\n- Comprehensive test suite with RSpec, Capybara, FactoryBot\n\n**Critical Rules Noted:**\n- Security: Use bcrypt, strong parameters, policy objects, parameterized queries\n- i18n: Only member/guest-facing interfaces (not staffer/admin)\n- Testing: Avoid `let`, use explicit setup, prefer `instance_double` over `double`\n- Code style: Follow .rules directory guidelines for all changes\n\n**Operating Constraints:**\n- READ-ONLY MODE: No file creation, modification, deletion, or system state changes\n- Can search with Glob and Grep for pattern matching\n- Can read files with Read tool\n- Bash only for read operations (ls, cat, find, git status, etc.)\n\nI'm ready to efficiently search and analyze the codebase.
