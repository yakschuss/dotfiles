It's currently the only place we set the 'audience' (in a PR that's going to be merged, will share that in a second: https://github.com/hellobrightline/reef/pull/17877). Product has asked that we add a dropdown for the modal for 'single session booking'. We need an audience dropdown. Here are the ticket details: ince we’ve changed our appointment types for DEs to have a caregiver/child attribute, we need to add a conditional dropdown for the 60-60-60 DE appointment types to the modal below to allow MS to select whether a DE appointment is for a caregiver or child when booking a single session.\n\nThe single session booking is used when 1 appointment of the 3 is cancelled and needs to be rescheduled. This cannot be done via the clinic tool. So we need to allow MS to designate the Party it’s for here.\n\n \n\nLet’s add a conditional dropdown and label it Party. The values in the dropdown should be Caregiver and Child.

{"display":"Here's the ticket description: Description\n\nOften times members begin telling the MES a lot of information throughout the call and they would like to document it during the call. Currently if they start a call outcome and click off the tab they will lose the notes they started. \n\nEither having notes autosave if they click off the tab or have notes box carry from page to page in clinic tool. Just slows the MES down with getting accounts created and being able to capture important notes. The relevant controller is @app/controllers/staffers/phone_desk/call_logs_controller.rb . I want to introduce the autosave, but I think the last time we introduced it, it was slightly brittle. Let's design a more robust autosave solution that is a repeatable pattern. I'd like to apply Domain Driven Design principles to autosaving. Essentially, the domain here is that there's an ctive call in the background, and the MS person is moving quickly. We should easily be able to make any part of the form auto-savable. Let's think through the design carefully before we start writing code.","pastedContents":{},"timestamp":1765554538162,"project":"/Users/jschuss/Brightline/reef","sessionId":"dab23246-a8e1-4319-bd94-2bcb84a16eab"}
