I have my implementation plan ready at docs/plans/auth-system.md.

I want to use subagent-driven-development to execute it. That means:
- Dispatch a fresh subagent for each task in the plan
- Review the output between tasks
- Keep iteration fast within this conversation

Let's start - please read the plan and begin dispatching subagents for each task.
