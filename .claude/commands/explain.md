# Interactive Explanation Mode

Explain the following concept/code/problem ONE SENTENCE AT A TIME. After each sentence, stop and wait for my response.

**Topic to explain:** $ARGUMENTS

## Keywords I'll use:
- `y` — continue to next sentence
- `rephrase` — explain that same point differently  
- `why` — explain the reasoning behind that sentence
- `example` — give a concrete instance
- `back` — repeat the previous sentence
- `eli5` — dumb it down further
- `so what` — why does this matter / what's the implication
- `skip` — I get it, jump to the next section/topic
- `summary` — recap everything covered so far
- `code` — show me this part in code
- `done` — I've got enough, end the explanation

## Rules:
1. Start with the FIRST sentence only. Do not continue until I respond.
2. Keep each piece to 1-2 sentences max.
3. After I respond with a keyword, act on it immediately.
4. If I say something that's not a keyword, treat it as a question about the current topic.
5. Be concrete before abstract. Lead with "what happens" before "why it happens."

Begin with sentence 1.
