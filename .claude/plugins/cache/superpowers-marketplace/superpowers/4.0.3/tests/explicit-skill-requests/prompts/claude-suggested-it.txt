[Previous assistant message]:
Plan complete and saved to docs/plans/auth-system.md.

Two execution options:
1. Subagent-Driven (this session) - I dispatch a fresh subagent per task, review between tasks, fast iteration within this conversation
2. Parallel Session (separate) - Open a new Claude Code session with the execute-plan skill, batch execution with review checkpoints

Which approach do you want to use for implementation?

[Your response]:
subagent-driven-development, please
