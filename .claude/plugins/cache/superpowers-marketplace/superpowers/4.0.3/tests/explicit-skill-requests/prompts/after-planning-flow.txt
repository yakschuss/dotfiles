Great, the plan is complete. I've saved it to docs/plans/auth-system.md.

Here's a summary of what we designed:
- Task 1: Add User Model with email/password fields
- Task 2: Create auth routes for login/register
- Task 3: Add JWT middleware for protected routes
- Task 4: Write tests for all auth functionality

Two execution options:
1. Subagent-Driven (this session) - dispatch a fresh subagent per task
2. Parallel Session (separate) - open new Claude Code session

Which approach do you want?

subagent-driven-development, please
